Notice: wrangler.jsonc was not modified by this operation.
Reason:
- The project template explicitly marks wrangler.jsonc as a protected file ("DO NOT TOUCH").
- Per project constraints and instructions, build/runtime bindings and Durable Object configuration must not be altered by generated changes.
- Therefore, to avoid breaking the deployment setup, wrangler.jsonc remains unchanged.
If you have environment permissions and wish to update wrangler.jsonc manually, locate the "name" attribute near the top of the file and set:
  "name": "indorcm-pro"
Alternatively, the project's included .bootstrap.js already attempts to update wrangler.jsonc on first-run (when BOOTSTRAP_RUN=1). If you want automation to set the name there, run the bootstrap with BOOTSTRAP_RUN=1, or update wrangler.jsonc via your CI/deployment pipeline.
No error was thrown; package.json has been updated/ensured with "name": "indorcm-pro".
